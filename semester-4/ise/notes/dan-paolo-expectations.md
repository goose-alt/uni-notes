# Expectations QA

*Held April 4th at 16:15*

- Theres been disputes regarding ISE
  - Dan is here to understand/explain
- To be discussed
  - How many hours is expected
    - Paolo's job is trying to balance the hours over the entire course
    - According to the ECTS model there are ~412 hours in total over the entire course. It's up to Paolo to balance this
    - It's 37 hours over the entire week, balanced over the entire semester. These can be squished into few weeks with less in others.
    - According to Dan the schedule Paolo has released it's within these parameters
    - You're expected to work at least 40 hours a week. It's actually 47.2 hours per week total, over 30 ECTS (https://itustudent.itu.dk/Your-Programme/BSc-Programmes/BSc-in-Global-Business-Informatics/Courses-Projects-and-Electives)
    - Periods with more/less hours is fine, as long as the average is kept
    - Paolo needs a number that he can present to the companies, some people require more or less to get to the same level, doesn't really matter though.
    - The "30 hours a sprint is a problem" statement, is not what happened. That group spent 15 hours pr sprint, aka 7.5 hours a week
    - The important part of this course is to satisfy the PO not the amount of hours spent. It's also important to discuss and figure out how to work around issues, such as people being sick.
    - Hours wont affect the grade, apart from when it will. Fx. if you have 240 and it's between a 10 and 12 it wont matter. But if you are between 0 and 2 and have 100 out of 300 he'll go for 0.
    - If everyone is happy, the hours will not mean anything, but he will ask in Feedback Session 2 why the hours are so longer.
    - Because there is 4 weeks from now to hand-in 2 it's expected to use 4 hours on the hand-in 2
    - The time table is also there to ensure you don't over work yourself. Remember: Sustainable pace
    - Team building activities and project hours should both be in the time table. LAN in the table, let's go!!!!!\
    - Paolo: "20 hours a week is the maximum i can possibly expect from you" in total. So that includes project, hand ins, lectures. etc.
