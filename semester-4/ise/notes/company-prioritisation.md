| Rating | Company         | Notes                                                  |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|        | Solita          | AI prediction. A lot of data to process. Using real time data from multiple data sources to suggest the most suitable speed limit |
|        | Blue Atlas Rob. | Underwater scanning, robotics, automated piloting, contributing to a open source project, 3d modelling and viewing | 
|        | DHI             | Water data, data processing, geography based news, show news on a map, integrate realtime data with mainstream media news | 
|        | Novo Nordisk    | Torturing samples, a lot of data to process. Data aggregation and calculating. Not very clear what the product is. |
|        | Valtech         | Nice and familiar tech stack, the project is very wide, and the feature we decide to implement is very much up to us. |
|        | DSV             | Microservices, Large impact, Looks kind of small in the current product | 
|        | Mamami          | Small focused team, dev team tool suite, a large tool that will contain many small tools focused on development. Basically teams for development. It doesn't seem very fleshed out in the minds of the creator |
| NITR   | SalesComm       | Not that interesting, small impact, just branding stuff, iOS focused | 
| NITR   | Tastelater      | The necessary development is not that interesting | 
| NITR   | Cyberjuice      | Stupid name, gamifying cyber security learning, goal is to create a knowledge based recommender, it's a large project starting from scratch. The goal itself is neat enough | 
| NITR   | Devaten         | Trace query locations by adding tags to the query itself, monitoring |
| NITR   | Ecerto          | Dat accent tho, large projects with wide definitions, working with megaprojects, focused on data processing in one of the projects |
| NITR   | Fellowmind      | Collection of navigation data, what in this project can not be done by Google analytics? Microservices, familiar technologies |
| NITR   | IBM             | VR focused, scrum and agile in VR, seems boring. Focused on not working physically together, makes sense tbh, unfamiliar technologies not very focused on the coding. |
| NITR   | OPPI AI         | Recommender engine to recommend language learning resources to learners.  |
| NITR   | StudentPulse    | Student data and feedback, actually a product i feel should be built. How to improve surveys? |
| NITR   | Systematic      | Hiring system to attract candidates and track them. |
