https://learnit.itu.dk/pluginfile.php/313725/mod_resource/content/1/Scrum%20Guide%202020.pdf

Scrums is a framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions to complex problems.

## Scrum values
- Courage
  - Courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems
- Focus
  - Allows for focus on the work in the sprint
- Commitment
  - Commit to achieving goals, usually of the sprint or the team
- Respect
  - Respect each other and capabilities
- Openness
  - Be open about the work and the challenges while performing the work

## Scrum pillars / theory
- Transparency 
  - The process must be visible to those performing and recieving the work
  - Enables inspection
- Inspection
  - Scrum artifacts must be inspected frequently
  - Allows for noticing undesirable variance and problems
  - Enabled by the 5 events
  - Enables adaption
- Adaption
  - Adjustments to the process or work
  - Applied when deviating outside of acceptable limits
  - Enabled by inspection
  - Must be made as soon as possible to minimize deviation
  - Difficult when people are not empowered to make change

## Scrum artifacts
- Product backlog
  - Ordered list of things needed to improve the product
  - Single source of work
  - Items that can be done in one sprint is ready for selection
  - Refinement is breaking down and furher defining Product Backlog items
  - Commitment: Product goal
    - Describes the future state of the product
    - Serves as a target for what the Scrum team should plan against
- Sprint backlog
  - Composed of the sprint goal (why), Product Backlog items (what), plan for delivering (how)
  - Realtime picture of what the Developers plan to accomplish in a sprint
  - Updated throughout the sprint as more is learned
  - Commitment: Sprint goal
    - Single objective for the sprint
    - Creates coherence and focus
    - Encourages working together rather than on seperate initiatives
    - Developed during Sprint Planning
    - If work turns out to not work towards the Sprint Goal, the team renegotiates the Sprint Backlog, with the PO, so it fits the Sprint Goal
- Increment
  - Concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal
  - Additive to prior increments and verified to work with them.
  - Multiple increments may be created within a Sprint.
  - The sum of increments in a Sprint is what is presented at the Sprint Review
  - Commitment: Definition of Done
    - Formal description of the Increment state when it meets the desired quality for the Product
    - When a Product Backlog items meets the DOD, an Increment is born
    - Provides a shared understanding of work that was completed as part of an increment.
    - An item cannot be released if it does not meet the DOD
    - If the sprint is over and an item does not fullfill the DOD it goes back into the Product Backlog for future consideration
    - If the organization has a DOD it must be followed, if they dont the Scrum team should make their own

## Scrum team
- **Developers**
  - Perform the work
  - Skills
    - Creating a plan for the sprint, as in the sprint backlog
    - Adhering to the Definition of done to ensure quality
    - Adapting plans towards the sprint goal
    - Holding each other accountable
- Product Owner (PO)
  - Must maximize the value of the product resulting from the work
  - Accountable the backlog management, by
    - Developing and communicating the product goal
    - Creating and communication Product Backlog items
    - Ordering Product Backlog items, usually by priority
    - Ensuring the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood
  - Is always accountable for the above, even thought he delagates responsibility
  - PO's opinion and choices may be changed by other team members if they can convince (him/her)
- Scrum master
  - Accountable for the teams effectiveness
  - Helps the team improve its practices, in the scrum framework
  - Must foster an environment where
    - A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
    - The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
    - The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
    - *Repeat*
  - Serves the team by
    - Coaching in self-management
    - Helping the team focus on creating high value
    - Removing the impediments to the teams progress
    - Ensuring all Scrum events take place, are positive and timeboxed
  - Serves the PO by
    - Finding techniques for effective product goal definition and product backlog management
    - Helping the team understand the importance of clear Product Backlog items
    - Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
    - Facilitating skateholder collaboration
  - Serves the organization by
    - Leading, training and coaching the organization in scrum adoption
    - Planning and advising on scrum implementations
    - Helping employees and stakeholders undestand the empirical approach for complex work
    - Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum teams

## Scrum events
- Sprint
  - Fixed length for consistency
  - During a sprint:
    - No changes are made that would endanger the sprint goal
    - Quality does not decrease
    - Product Backlog is refined as needed
    - Scope may be clarified or renogatiated as more is learned
  - Ensures inspection and adaption towards the Product Goal.
  - May be considered a short project
  - Shorter sprints may be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort
  - May be cancelled if the sprint goal becomes obsolete
    - Can only be done by the PO
- Sprint planning
  - Addresses:
    - Why is this sprint valuable
      - PO proposes product value increase
      - Team collaborates on Sprint Goal, that communicates the value to stakeholders
    - What can be done this sprint
      - Developers, with input from PO, select items from Product Backlog to include in the Sprint Backlog
      - The items may be refined throught this process
      - May be done with the help of Story Points
    - How will the chosen work get done
      - Decompose backlog items into smaller smaller work items
      - Done solely by the developers
    - The sprint goal, product backlog items selected and the plan to complete are referred to as the sprint backlog
- Daily scrum
  - 15 minute event
  - Inspect progress towards sprint goal
  - Adapt the backlog if necessary
  - Improves communictation and identifies impediments
  - Discuss how to move forward
- Sprint review
  - Inspect the outcome of the sprint
  - Team presents ther work to stakeholders
  - Progress towards Product Goal is discussed
  - Product backlog may be adjusted if new opportunitites has risen
  - Should never be considered a gate to releasing value
- Sprint retrospective
  - Increase quality and effectiveness
  - Inspects the last sprint with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools and DOD
  - Assumptions that led astray and their origins are explored
  - Discuss what went well, not so well and how those problems are or could be fixed
  - Identify helpful changes to improve efficiency
    - These must be addressed as soon as possible
  - Concludes the sprint
- *repeat*

## Dictionary
- Empirical
  - based on, concerned with, or verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.
