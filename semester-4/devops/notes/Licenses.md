# Licenses

- Allows you to still monetize open source software

## Copyright

- Exclusive right that creators have over their literary and artistic works
  - This also counts for code
- Needs to be:
  - Original, must not be copied
  - Must be independent by some party, not stolen basically
  - Must be the result of a creative process. Fx. a simple print statement doesn't count. But a new algorithm does.
- Copyright is automatic
  - You don't need to register the work
  - You don't need to publisice the work
  - You don't have to use a symbol.
  - If you created it, and it adheres to the rules of copyright, then it's copyrighted
  - One exception: If you work for someone, your employer gets the copyright to the code
- If multiple people have created the product, then all the creators are equal co-owners.
- With copyright you get:
  - The right to reproduce and make copies of the original work.
  - The right to create derivative works

## Open Source Licenses

- A license is an agreement between the creator and the user. It
  - grants the user certain right to use the work
  - may be subject to certain conditions. Fx according to the mongodb license you cannot earn money from hosting it
