# Lecture 7

## Part A

1. c
2. See below
   1. a, b, d
   2. a,b,c,d
3. b
4. See below. a = Tr + Ts
   1. n * (a + Ttr)
   2. a + n * Ttr
5. When you have to erase data before writing to it, which would cause 2 times the logical amount of data to write
6. a,c
7. Typically 2 pr core

## Part B

1. See below
   1. B, C
   2. 2NF
   3. BC and CAD
2. See below
   1. BD
   2. 2NF
   3. DA and BC and BD
3. See below
   1. ABCD
   2. 3NF
   3. No decompose
4. See below
   1. A
   2. 2NF
   3. ABC and BCD
5. See below
   1. AB, BC, AD, CD
      1. Because AB points to C and D, but C -> A removes AC, and D->B removes BD. Since C and D are on their own  but together can decide AB, CD also exists
   2. 3NF
