\pgfmathsetmacro\totalpoints{\totalpoints + 4}

\point{4} For each of the statements below, mark whether the statement is true or false.  
Each correct answer \underline{gains} you 1 mark;
each incorrect answer \underline{loses} you 1 mark;
a question left unanswered neither loses nor gains marks.
The final points for this question is calculated by bounding the sum of marks between 0 and 4 points.  In other words, each answer has a positive or negative impact of half a point.

			In the late `80s, Brooks highlighted how old software processes were not fit to manage software engineering projects due to the intrinsic properties of software (i.e., changeability, invisibility, conformity, and complexity).  After his seminal article, several software process models were proposed to takle such properties, a process that culminated with agile processes like Scrum and Extreme Programming. \\[3pt]
