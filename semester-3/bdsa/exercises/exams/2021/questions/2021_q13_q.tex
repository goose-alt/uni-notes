\point{6} Many claim that Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the processes that fall under the Agile methodology.  If this is the case, it should be possible to draw parallels between the elements of XP and the values and principles described in the Manifesto for agile software development document -- given it is considered to be the reference document for the philosophy (or point of view) that the authors of the document stood by.  
You want to convince skeptics that the above is true, that links can be drawn even though the book by Kent Beck describing XP is older than the Manifesto for agile software development. 

Your task is to clearly outline \textbf{three} such links.  In particular, you are expected to clearly detail: the chosen element of XP, the chosen value or principle of the Manifesto, and the reason behind their conceptual alignment.
