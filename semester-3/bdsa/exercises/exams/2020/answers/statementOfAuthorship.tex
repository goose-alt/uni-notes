\subsubsection*{Statement of Authorship}
Your solutions and answers must be made by you and you only. 
This applies to 
explanatory text,
program code, 
examples, 
tables, 
charts, 
diagrams, and 
any other element comprising the answers you submit to the exam questions. 
It is expected that you are familiar with the presence, meaning, and operationalization of the Academic Misconduct concept\footnote{https://itustudent.itu.dk/Study-Administration/Exams/Academic-Misconduct}.
For convenience, some important -- but not comprehensive -- points are elaborated: 
(i) you are not allowed to create the exam solutions as group work, nor to consult with fellow students, pose questions via internet fora, chat, SMS, phone, mail or the like; 
(ii) you are allowed to use someone else's work insofar as correctly referenced. 
Finally, as in all exams, you are allowed to communicate with SAP in case you believe there is a problem with exam questions; you received guidelines regarding this from SAP.

Your solution must contain the following signed declaration, which for simplicity given the digital nature of this exam can be produced by uncommenting the last lines in \el{statementOfAuthorship.tex} and filling in the macros in \el{[BDSA'21] - Exam Solutions.tex}, which will result in the following text appearing at the end of this page: \textbf{``I hereby declare that I have answered these exam questions myself without any outside help. (date) (name)''}.
