# Lesson 10 - Advanced javascript
## Call stack
- Synchronous, aka stuff waits for it to finish, like a queue, things happen linearly

## Async/Await
- Run in the background on a different thread. Await get's the result.
- Promises is JS's way of saying i have this on a different thread, i promise you i'll return it to you at some point.
