# Lesson 9 - Design processes
## Why?
A design process is a suggestion, not a convention. Much like the one from Geneva

- To explain to customers how we work
- To give a sense of security and flow in the project
- To fix or handle problems before they happen
- To not have confusion about how to approach a project or problem
- Because we are told to.

## Don Norman
Takeaways:
- Provide a good conceptual model
	- A conceptual model, is a sort of sketch or wireframe.
	- "A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effect of our actions"
	- Basically, a good model explains how the system would react
- Make things or state visible
	- Show the state of the system
	- Loading bars
	- Input validation
- Provide feedback to the user
	- Make the user aware of what they are doing
	- Input validation
	- Errors
	- Notifications
	- Tell them what they are doing wrong: "The password must contain a special character"
	- Has to be immediate
- Affordances and constraints
	- Signal properties of the material, or product without signs
	- FX: A vertical doorhandle is akward to push, but not to pull, and a horizontal one is the opposite, thereby signalling the constraints of the door by the door handle.
- Mappings
	- Physical placement of elements, tell something about their purpose
	- Light switches near lamps, indicate that they belong together.

## Design modeller
- The simple one
	- Initial state -> Process -> Final state
	- Analysis -> Synthesis -> Evaluation
	- Discover -> Ideate -> Embodiment -> Develop
- Waterfall
	- Linear from one end to the other
- V-Model
	- Allows backtracking to a certain point
- Double diamond
	- Principles
		- Be people centered
		- Communicate
		- Collaborate
		- Iterate, Iterate, Iterate
	- Process
		- Start by discovering the problem, wide
		- Define the solution, narrow, you can start over here
		- Develop the solution, wide,
		- Finish the product and devliver, narrow, you can go back to develop here
		- Start over

## Design problems
A design problem is a situation and an undesired outcome. A problem occurs when the product and it's relation to the problem, user or business isn't aligned. A design problem is unique and therefore isn't always well defined, so called wicked problems, seen below:

- Not properly defined
- Lacks an end state
- Solutions are not true or false, but good or bad
- There is no immediate or ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem
- A solution to a wicked problem is a "on-shot-operation", as you usually only have on attempt to solve the problem
- Do not have a set of possible solutions
- Every wicked problem is a unique challenge
- Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of a different problem
- The problem can be described in many ways, the chosen description determines the problem's solution
