# Lesson 7 - Prototyping and user testing
## Integrating prototyping into design process
While designing on should prototype to test out ideas. The further one get's in the process one can increase the fidelity of the prototypes. The first should be very low fidelety just to test out concepts.

## 8 methods of prototyping
- Sketches, very low fidelity, basically just concepts
- Paper interfaces, allows the user to interact with the wireframe, tell the user how the interface responds to their interaction
- Storyboards, visualize the user journey. Basically a sketch for the application flow.
- Lego prototypes, quick and cheap way of prototyping physical products.
- Role-Playing, pretend to interact with the product and record what happens.
- Physical models, mockup of the product in the real world to gather feedback, and physical interaction feedback.
- Wizard of Oz, fake product interaction to see how the user reacts to the interaction, even though it is not the actual response. Fx, hard coded search results or manual algorithmic responses.
- User-Driven, get the user to design what they want, and create a prototype from that. Allows you to learn more about the user, as well as getting a physical representation of what they are thinking they want out of the product.

## User testing
Not everyone are the same, developers, users, designers, ceo's, everyone likes something different. Therefore it is important to know who you are focussing on with your product.

User testing should be done to test the application, not settle internal debates. Example: "User testing is done to decide what drapes to use, only to find out they forgot to put windows in the room"

### Different types
- Usability testing
	- Sit one user down and observe them use the application
	-	Fix any frustrations
	- Make sure to not interrrupt, this is about the user, not you
- Focus group
	- Small group of people sit down and talk about their experiences, past present and future.
	- Good for quickly getting a sample of user feelings or opinions.
	- Bad for finding out how things work, or don't.

So the usability is about the use, the focus groupis about what they want or like.

### Truths about usability testing
- If you want a great site, you have to test. 
	- You can stare yourself blind, or be blinded by a labor of love, doesn't mean it fits the users
- Testing one user is 100% better than testing none.
	- Always test, only if it's just a little bit, and do it early (MVP)
- Testing one user early is better than 50 near the end
	- Testing early allows you to change major design decisions that just don't work, you can't do that near the end.
	- Minimum Viable Product strategy should be used.

### How often?
- As much as possible.
- A morning a month, with a few users
	- It's simple
	- Gives you what you need, in terms of how the progress since last time helped.
	- Frees you from deciding what to test, you always have a little to test, so test that
	- Predictable schedules are good for getting people to attend.

### How many users?
- 3
	- It's a small group which allows you to go into depth
	- The purpose is not to prove, but improve
	- You don't need to find all the problems, just the major ones, and the small gripes the users have

### Where?
- Quiet room, isolated from outside experiences.

### Who?
- Users
	- Someone within the target audience
	- Someone outside
	- Someone in the middle
- Facilitators
	- A people person
	- Not too talkative
	- Someone who can restrain himself/herself from explaining too much
- Observers
	- As many as possible from the development team, it really changes peoples opinions 

### What?
Whatever you did since last time. Else the major features.

### What to do afterwards?
- Make a list of the major points
- Choose the ten biggest problems
- Rate them
- Create an ordered list of what to fix and in what order
- Make a list of easily fixable low hanging fruit, for the slow days
- Don't add things, remove instead. Don't add notifications, or instructions, remove what obscures the meaning.
- New feature requests should be at the bottom of the pile, and take them with a grain of salt.
- Users deviating slightly from the beaten path, it's only really a problem if they get lost completely.
