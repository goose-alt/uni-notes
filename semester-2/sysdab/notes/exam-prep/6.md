# Lesson 6 - Responsive design
## Responsive design
Not all screen sizes can contain the same content, so responsive design is the act of scaling and changing the layout of the page to accomodate the screen it is viewed on.

## Responsive Design patterns
### Mostly fluid
- Adjusts margins on large or medium screens
- Reflows on smaller screens by stacking vertically
