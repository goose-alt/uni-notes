# Lesson 11 - Design patterns in CSS
## Variables
- Stores information

## Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
- Progressive enhancement
	- Build some sort of base functionality, and build upon it, based on what the browser is cabable of
- Graceful degradation
	- Build everything you want, and then remove things the browser can't do.

PolyFill exists, so fuck all of this

## Design patterns in CSS
- Don't repeat yourself
- Seperation of concerns, seperate sections of the code base into modules, such as:
	- Layout, handle flex box and shit ehre
	- Content, colours :)
- Utility-First CSS
	- Name CSS classes after their purpose. Such as bold-text, which would be a single line, instead of repeating that one line multiple times.

## Material Design
A type of very flat and white design. I really like it.
